Didn't know what to say on the first day
But I was such a fool I didn't tell you
That I needed someone like you in my life
Every little things we have been through
Need a sun to shine where we want it to
I'll sing this song for the rest of my life
So how's it going?
'Cause I miss you
I heard a lot of birds whispering
Only about your name
Guess I know why
I started to cry
Every picture in my car
Reminds me the time I had
Been with you
Every little things we have been through
Need a sun to shine where we want it to
I'll sing this song for the rest of my life
So how's it going
'Cause I miss you
I heard a lot of birds whispering
Only about your name
Guess I know why
I started to cry
Every picture in my car
Reminds me the time I had
Been with you
So how's it going
'Cause I miss you
I heard a lot of birds whispering
Only about your name
Guess I know why
I started to cry
Every picture in my car
Reminds me the time I had
Been with you
Been with you
Every picture in my car
Reminds me the time I had
Been with you
